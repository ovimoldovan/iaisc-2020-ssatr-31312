The application was written using the IntelliJ IDE. The app requires the "json-simple" library, included in the Source files.

Running the app:
The Petri Net is loaded from the "input.json" file.
The application starts with the main() method (from the Main class).
The results are written in the application's console, as well as in the "output.txt" file.

Other info:
"ClassDiagram.jpg" represents the UML diagram.
mainHardCoded() method, inputTest and outputTest files were used as a simpler way to test in the development process.
